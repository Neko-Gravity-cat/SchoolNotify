**Grab announcements from the school website.**

## What is SchoolNotify?
SchoolNotify is an online service, which can automaticity collect newest information from your school's website, and then sent them into your email inbox.

## How can I use it?
You can subscribe to this service [here](https://sn.nekogc.com). Please enter your email address and select your school. The system will then send you a confirmation email, please visit the link provided within 5 minutes (or the link will be invalid and need to subscribe again.)

Please note that this service is still in an early stage of development, which means the number of supported schools is very limited (currently there are only two) and is waiting to be increased. For now, *新竹高中*, *新竹女中*, *文華高中*, and *台中高工* are supported.

## When will I receive the news letters?
We will send you the news letter at 6pm on every Monday and Thursday, containing new announcements from your school.

## How can I unsubscribe from this service?
Each letter we sent to you has a link to unsubscribe at the bottom of the mail.

## Where's my information stored? Are they safe?
This service is hosted on [replit.com](https://replit.com), all of the data is stored in their built-in database. Only the developer of this replit project (me, nekogravitycat) can visit the database, we won't use or share any information anywhere.

To use this service, you only have to provide your email address, and we'll automatically generate a password stored in our database. Without the password, no one can modify your subscription status. The password will be included in the unsubscribe link we send to you, so please don't worry anything about that.

All of your information will be deleted permanently once you unsubscribe.
