## Where's my information stored? Are they safe?
This service and the data are hosted and stored on my own server in Taiwan.
Only the developer of this project (me, nekogravitycat) can visit the database.
We won't use or share any information anywhere.

The password will be included in the unsubscribe link we send to you,
